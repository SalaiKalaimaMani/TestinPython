# Taks 3: diff between = operator and == operator:
# = Operator is used for assignment operations. EX: a = 10.
# == Operator is used for comparsion operations. EX : a==10
a = 10
b = 20
print(a == b)

#What does the ** operator do in Python
   # it will do Exponentiation multiplication
# EX:
print(4**5)

#What does the ^ operator do in Python
#compares each bit and set it to 1 if only one is 1, otherwise (if both are 1 or both are 0) it is set to 0:
# 6 = 0000000000000110
# 3 = 0000000000000011
# --------------------
# 5 = 0000000000000101
# ====================

print (6^3)
